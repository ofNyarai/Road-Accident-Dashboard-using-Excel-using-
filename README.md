KEY INSIGHTS 

Total Casualties: There were 408,854 casualties over the 2-year period.

High Proportion of Car Accidents: Car accidents account for 79.8% of the total casualties.

Yearly Comparison: The year 2021 had slightly higher casualties than 2022.

Monthly Trends: October and November had the highest number of accidents, while January and February saw the lowest.

Injury Severity: Slight injuries make up the bulk of casualties (84%), while fatalities are considerably low (1.7%).

Road Type: Single road carriageways account for a staggering 304,171 casualties, whereas slip roads have the lowest number of casualties (4,602).

Road Conditions: The highest casualties occur on dry road conditions.

Location: Urban areas experience the highest number of casualties.

Time of Day: Most accidents occur during the day.



RECOMMENDATIONS 

Enhanced Road Safety Campaigns: Focus on raising awareness about road safety, especially during high-risk months like October and November. Campaigns should emphasize the importance of cautious driving in urban areas and on single road carriageways.

Improved Road Infrastructure: Invest in better road design and maintenance, particularly on single road carriageways where the majority of casualties occur. This could include adding more lanes, improving signage, and ensuring roads are well-lit.

Speed Control Measures: Implement stricter speed limits and enforce them rigorously, especially in urban areas and during the day when most accidents occur. Speed cameras and regular police patrols can help deter speeding.

Driver Education Programs: Enhance driver education programs to emphasize the dangers of speeding, distracted driving, and driving under the influence. These programs should also teach defensive driving techniques.

Weather-Related Precautions: Although most accidents occur on dry roads, it's important to educate drivers on how to handle different weather conditions. This includes driving slower in wet or icy conditions and ensuring vehicles are equipped with appropriate tires.


CONCLUSION

This Road Accident Analytics Dashboard provides a gateway to data-driven decisions, enabling stakeholders to implement evidence-based interventions to curtail accident casualties. It serves as a valuable tool for traffic authorities, safety advocates and policy makers.
